# Financial Performance \& Budget Analysis

**Overview**



This project analyzes financial performance by comparing actual revenue and expenses against budgeted targets over a 12-month period. It is designed to reflect real-world FP\&A and business analyst workflows.



**Dashboards**



**Executive Summary**



* Provides a high-level view of performance vs plan:
* Total Revenue and Expenses
* Weighted variance vs budget (%)
* Dollar variance ($ impact)
* Monthly Budget vs Actual trends



Variance interpretation:



* Revenue: positive variance = favorable
* Expenses: negative variance = favorable



**Performance Drivers**



Explains why performance changed:



* Month-over-Month Revenue Growth (%)
* Department-level expense analysis



This separation keeps the summary focused while enabling root-cause analysis.



**Methodology**



* Monthly data aggregation
* Budget modeled at departmental level
* Variance % calculated using weighted totals (total actual vs total budget)
* MoM growth calculated with lag functions

* Data was generated and modeled for analysis using SQL and aggregated to monthly grain for dashboarding.



**Tools \& Skills**



* SQL (aggregation, window functions, variance analysis)
* Tableau (dashboard design, KPIs, trend analysis)
* Financial \& business analysis



**Key Takeaways**



* Small monthly variances can compound into material annual impact
* Department-level costs drive expense performance
* Separating summary metrics from drivers improves decision-making
